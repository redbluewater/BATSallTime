I cloned the BIOS-SCOPE/data_pipeline repository as I have made so many changes that it was going to be messy for the original intended use of the data_pipeline. Working in redbluewater account for now, but will also tidy up the BIOS-SCOPE data_pipeline to go back to where I was in Ruth's MATLAB code. 

## Some git notes for Krista
Edit file(s) on my local computer, then to get the files back to GitHub, use this set of commands to put onto GitHub:

```git add -A``` *or* ```git add MATLAB_code/\ *``` (or whatever folder you want)\
```git commit -am "Brief description goes here"``` (can use the bit in quotes to describe the update)\
```git push```\
(enter the passcode I use to get files to GitHub)
