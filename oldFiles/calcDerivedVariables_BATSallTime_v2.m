%Set up to calculate Ruth's derived variables from all BATS cruises (e.g.,
%MLD, season, and VZ); starting with BATS cruise #1
%based on Ruth's prior code : create_biosscope_files_2022_2023.m
% Original code from Ruth Curry, BIOS / ASU
% Krista Longnecker; 8 February 2024
% Some notes from Krista (8 February 2024)
% (1) you will need to update the path information and file names
% up through row ~27 in this code. There should be no need to change
% anything past that point.
% (2) The output from this code will be (1) a series CSV files, one per cruise,
% that will be saved in 'outdir', defined at line 22, and (2) one giant
% file with all the information concatenated together.
