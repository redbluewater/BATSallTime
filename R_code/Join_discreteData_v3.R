#Some notes from Krista: 
# (1) you will need to update the path information and file names up through row ~50 in this code. 
# There should be no need to change anything past that point.
# (2) This script will open a single worksheet in Excel - that worksheet needs to copied into the bottle
# file, and then header gets copied from the prior version of the bottle file. I cannot use the 
# that would (in theory) allow the formatting to be copied because it creates a corrupted Excel file
